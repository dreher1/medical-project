Welcome to our BIO-185 project on data visualization for Melanoma cases in the United States.

On this website, you can view and visualize the following data:

Melanoma Cases by County: This visualization is created from data collected by the National Cancer Institute. It contains the number of cases (average annual count from the years 2017-2021) for each county. The data is collected on a per-county basis.

UV Measurement: This is another choropleth map that shows the intensity of UV (in Watts per square meter) for each county in the choropleth map. The data is taken from the National Institute for Cancer GIS Portal for Patient Research, and contains the average values for intensity from the years 2020-2024.
